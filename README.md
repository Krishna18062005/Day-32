# Heart Disease Prediction Using Federated Learning Algorithms  

This project implements a *Heart Disease Prediction Model* using Federated Learning techniques. The goal is to predict heart disease by training models collaboratively across decentralized client datasets without sharing raw data. This ensures *data privacy* while still achieving a high-performance global model.

## Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This project leverages *Federated Learning (FL)*, a machine learning approach that trains a shared model across multiple decentralized edge devices or servers. Each client (device) has its local heart disease dataset, and only model updates are shared with a central server.

The Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm is used to train a global model efficiently, maintaining *data privacy*.

---

## Features

- *Federated Learning Implementation*: Train models collaboratively without sharing sensitive data.
- *Heart Disease Prediction*: Utilize neural network-based models to predict the presence of heart disease.
- *Privacy-Preserving Training*: Clients process data locally, and only updates are communicated.
- *FedAvg Algorithm*: Aggregate client models to build an optimized global model.

---

## Architecture

The system follows a *Client-Server Federated Learning Architecture*:
1. *Clients*: Each client trains a local neural network model using their respective heart disease datasets.
2. *Server: Aggregates model updates (parameters) from all clients using the **FedAvg* algorithm and updates the global model.
3. *Global Model*: Shared back with clients to continue the collaborative training process.

---

## Technologies Used

- *Python*: Programming language.
- *TensorFlow/Keras*: Framework for building and training the neural network.
- *NumPy*: Data manipulation and numerical computations.
- *Pandas*: Handling and analyzing tabular data.
- *Matplotlib*: Visualizing model training results and performance.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. *Clone the Repository*:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krishna18062005/Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Federated-Learning-Algorithms.git
   cd Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Federated-Learning-Algorithms
   

2. *Install Dependencies*:
   Ensure you have Python (3.6+) and pip installed. Install the required libraries:
   bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib
   

3. *Prepare Datasets*:
   - Place your heart disease datasets in a suitable format (e.g., CSV).
   - Ensure each client dataset is stored separately.

4. *Run the Code*:
   Execute the script to train and evaluate the global model:
   bash
   python federated_heart_disease.py

## How It Works

1. *Dataset Preparation*: Each client processes their own subset of the heart disease dataset locally.
2. *Model Initialization*: A common neural network architecture is defined.
3. *Local Training*:
   - Each client trains the neural network using their local dataset.
   - The model parameters are updated locally.
4. *Server Aggregation*:
   - The server collects model updates (weights) from each client.
   - Using the *FedAvg* algorithm, the server aggregates the updates to form a new global model.
5. *Global Model Distribution*:
   - The updated global model is sent back to the clients for further training.
6. *Repeat*: Steps 3â€“5 are repeated for multiple rounds until convergence.

## Results

The model demonstrates promising results for heart disease prediction. The following metrics can be tracked:

- *Training Accuracy*
- *Validation Accuracy*
- *Loss*
- *Global Model Performance*

Example plot visualizations include:

- Accuracy over training rounds.
- Loss reduction across federated training iterations.

## Future Enhancements

The following improvements can be considered:
- *Integration of Additional Algorithms*: Extend beyond FedAvg to other federated learning strategies like FedProx or FedOpt.
- *Cluster-Based Predictions*: Develop a system to predict specific heart conditions (sub-categories).
- *Data Visualization*: Add comprehensive graphs for model metrics.
- *Deployment*: Deploy the model as a web-based application using Flask or FastAPI.
